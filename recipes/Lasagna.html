      Lasagna is an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna noodles
      alternating with fillings such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce),
      vegetables, and cheeses. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which
      becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the
      other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is
      cut into single-serving square portions.
