      French toast is a dish of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and often
      milk or cream, then pan-fried. When French toast is served as a sweet
      dish, sugar, vanilla, or cinnamon are also commonly added before
      pan-frying, and then it may be topped with sugar (often powdered sugar),
      butter, fruit, or syrup. When it is a savory dish, it is generally fried
      with a pinch of salt or pepper, and it can then be served with a sauce
      such as ketchup or mayonnaise.
